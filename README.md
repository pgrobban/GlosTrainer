GlosTrainer
===========

Initial version of a small desktop application for English-speaking learners of the Swedish language, made in C#. 

It has a GUI for adding, editing, deleting and sorting words. Optional word forms for nouns, verbs and adjectives are supported but not viewable in the main list. GlosTrainer supports importing and exporting word lists to/from XML.

A future release of the program will include flashcard/quiz mode and other features.
