GlosTrainer
===========

Initial version of a word learning application for English-speaking learners of the Swedish language, made in C#. 

It has a GUI for adding, editing, deleting searching and sorting words. Optional word forms for nouns, verbs and adjectives are supported but not viewable in the main list. Searching can be made exactly or partially, as well as being limited to only dictionary forms of words, or expanded to all forms of words.  GlosTrainer supports importing and exporting word lists to/from XML.

A future release of the program will include flashcard/quiz mode and other features.
